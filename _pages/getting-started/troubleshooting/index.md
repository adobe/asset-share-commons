## Issue: Pages do not render with styles and functionality on AEM Publish 

### Problem:

Pages render but CSS and JavaScript are not being loaded.

### Cause: 

Lack of read permissions on Editable Templates causing JavaScript and CSS does not load properly.

### Fix: 

This typically occurs due to a lack of `read` permissions (to the `everyone` user for the anonymous use case) on:

* `/conf/xxx/wcm/settings/templates`
* `/conf/xxx/wcm/settings/policies`

Use Sling Repository Initializer to set read permissions on these paths for everyone / anonymous.


### Issue: Unable to Download Assets Larger than 5GB in an Asset Share Commons-based Project

#### Problem:

When using Asset Share Commons (ASC) project on AEM as a Cloud Service, with anonymous access enabled, users may encounter a `503 Service Unavailable` error when downloading assets larger than 5GB. Downloads smaller than 5GB work as expected, but anything above this limit returns an error.

#### Cause:

The issue is related to segmented caching on the Fastly CDN. When an asset download request is made anonymously (i.e., without being logged in via AEM's Sling Authenticator), Fastlyâ€™s caching mechanisms prevent the download of assets larger than 5GB.

#### Fix:

As a workaround, you can modify the Vhost file to force the download requests to be non-cacheable by setting the appropriate headers.

```xml
<LocationMatch "^/content/dam.downloadbinaries.json?.*$">
    Header unset Cache-Control
    Header unset Expires
    Header always set Cache-Control "private"
</LocationMatch>
```
