title: Upgrading to Asset Share Commons
---

This is an abridged guide to upgrading from Asset Share Commons 1.x to Asset Share Commons 2.0.0+ (please upgrade to latest release, {{ site.data.asc.version }}).

Details of this can be found through the rest of the Getting Started section.

## Project-level updates

The following should be updated at a project level by the development team.

1. Ensure you are on __AEM as a Cloud Service__ or __AEM 6.5 SP7+__.
1. Ensure your custom project that includes Asset Share Commons is updated to the latest [AEM project structure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/developing/aem-project-content-package-structure.html).
    * If you were deploying Asset Share Commons source code directly, you'll want to re-think that now, and move to a custom, wrapping project.
1. [Embed Asset Share Commons {{ site.data.asc.version }} `all` artifact](../../development/deploying) in your AEM Maven Project's `all` project.
    * Make sure when deploying to __AEM as a Cloud Service__ make sure the `<classifier>cloud</classifier>` is used in the Maven dependency.
1. [Add a maven dependency on Asset Share Commons {{ site.data.asc.version }} `core` artifact](../../development/deploying) in your AEM Maven Project's `core`  project.
1. Define [Asset Rendition](../../development/asset-renditions) OSGi configurations for the asset renditions you use in your your AEM Maven Project's `ui.config` project's `config` folder.
1. Update your AEM Maven Project's `dispatcher` project with the required [filters](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/asset-share-commons/blob/develop/dispatcher/src/conf.dispatcher.d/filters/filters.any) and [cache-able HTTP request headers](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/asset-share-commons/blob/develop/dispatcher/src/conf.dispatcher.d/available_farms/asset-share-commons.farm#L92-L95).

## Content authoring updates

The following should be updated in AEM as apart of Asset Share Commons configuration, after the above project-level updates have been deployed.

1. Update the Search Page's > Page Properties > [Messages](../../structure/messages) and ensure all desired message text is filled out.
1. Update the Actions > Download > [Download Modal](../../actions/download) component as desired, selecting the [Asset Renditions](../development/asset-renditions) defined by the development team (via OSGi configurations).
1. Create and author the Actions > Downloads > [Downloads Modal](../../actions/downloads) component as desired.
    * _Only applies to AEM as a Cloud Service_
1. Update the Asset Details pages' [Renditions](../details/renditions), [Image](../details/image), and [Video](../details/video) components to use [Asset Renditions](../development/asset-renditions).
1. Don't forget to Publish all your changes!
